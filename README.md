# Awesome Machine Learning **Infrastructure** [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Target audience: Infrastructure Engineers building ML / DS infrastructure, who have a conceptual understanding of the domain they are building systems for and are primarily NOT 'data science' specialists. 

A curated list for machine learning / data science frameworks, libraries, software and resources for **building ML (or Data Science) platforms or infrastructure**. 

This list is not for ML / DS domain-specific technologies / projects. Thanks to [@josephmisiti](https://github.com/josephmisiti) who has an '[awesome](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)' list covering all that.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@stevencasey](https://twitter.com/stevencasey).

Also, a listed repository should be deprecated if:
* Repository's owner explicitly say that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).

# Data Engineering

* [Awesome Data Engineering](https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering) - 'Awesome' list of data platform technologies (majority of data eng content here is from the list there)
* [The Data Engineering Ecosystem: An Interactive Map](http://xyz.insightdataengineering.com/blog/pipeline_map.html) - Great interactive map of data eng systems.

# Metadata management
* [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/) - Data governance, Metadata management, Data Lineage

# Deployment

* [kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow) - making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML to diverse infrastructures.
* [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) 

# Ethics

* [Guidelines for ethical modeling](https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige/DISC-unconf) - A collection of resources and tools designed to provide guidelines for ethical modeling.

# Conferences
* [DataEngConf](https://www.dataengconf.com/about) - DataEngConf is the first technical conference that bridges the gap between data scientists, data engineers and data analysts.
* [AI NEXTCon](http://aisv18.xnextcon.com/) - Relatively small conference. Some good building ML infra talks mixed in with tracks on DS specialties. Decent hallway track due to small size. Light on sponsors/exhibitors.

# Podcasts
* [Data Engineering Podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/) - The show about modern data infrastructure.

# Weekly news
* [Data Engineering Weekly news](https://www.dataengweekly.com/) - provides weekly latest data eng news in your inbox
