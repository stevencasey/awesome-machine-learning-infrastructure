# Awesome Machine Learning **Infrastructure** [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list for machine learning / data science frameworks, libraries, software and resources for **building ML (or Data Science) platforms or infrastructure**. 

This list is not for ML / DS domain-specific technologies / projects. Thanks to [@josephmisiti](https://github.com/josephmisiti) who has an '[awesome](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)' list covering all that.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@stevencasey](https://twitter.com/stevencasey).

Also, a listed repository should be deprecated if:
* Repository's owner explicitly say that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).

Further resources:

TBD!
